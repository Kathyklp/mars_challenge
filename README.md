I received this from Cortney Totty: “In order for an assignment to count towards gradution, it requires any score above 0. Regarding the rubric and challenge grade you are correct. Your score is is based on the rubric.” I am sure I have completed enough to get the one point required to get credit for the assignment. 
I will complete the assignments later, on my own. I need to ensure that I have one point on each assignment to graduate. Based on the rubric I completed the following:
Requirements
Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News (40 points)
Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup). (10 points) completed
The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted. (20 points)
The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structure—specifically, a list of dictionaries. (10 points)
Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data (60 points)
The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Either Pandas or Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. The columns have the correct headings and data types. (15 points)
The data was analyzed to answer the following questions: (10 points)
How many months exist on Mars? (5 points)
How many Martian days' worth of data are there? (5 points)

Thank you for your time. Kathy
